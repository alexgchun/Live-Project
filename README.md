# Live-Project
### Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked on a Life Style website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. Using vanilla JavaScript was a great way to really understand the fundamentals, and work on problem solving. Although I could have spent countless hours styling the site to perfection, I learned that it would be better to make a highly functional website, that is responsive and easy to navigate. The form functionality story and api were the two main challenges I faced.
